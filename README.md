This repository constains Python 3 code of a
coalescence/aggregation column model
The code was used to produce the data and generate figures of the study
Collection/Aggregation in a Lagrangian cloud microphysical model:
Insights from column model applications
The code was run on Linux system with a C-shell, sed, gcc and Python 3
Copy the repository to any local directory.
Execute "csh ComputeAgg_dummy.csh" for running a box/column model simulation.
Execute "csh PlotAgg_dummy.csh" for a-posteriori plot gereration.
All parameters are set within the csh-scripts.
The folder Documentation contains a documentation.

p.s.:
Before running the program on your machine,
you may need to adapt a few calls/folders in the csh scripts
(the locations can be found by searching for "#### CHANGE").

See file "ProgramVersions.txt" for a list of program versions for which the code was successfully exectued.
